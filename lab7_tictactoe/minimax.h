// implement in a later milestone. It computes the row and column of the next
// move based upon: the current board and player.
//
// When called from the controlling state machine, you will call this function
// as follows:
// 1. If the computer is playing as X, you will call this function with
// is_Xs_turn = true.
// 2. If the computer is playing as O, you will call this function with
// is_Xs_turn = false.
// This function directly passes the  is_Xs_turn argument into the minimax()
// (helper) function.

// This returns one of 4 values: MINIMAX_X_WINNING_SCORE,
// MINIMAX_O_WINNING_SCORE, MINIMAX_DRAW_SCORE, MINIMAX_NOT_ENDGAME
// Note: the is_Xs_turn argument indicates which player just took their
// turn and makes it possible to speed up this function.
// Assumptions:
// (1) if is_Xs_turn == true, the last thing played was an 'X'.
// (2) if is_Xs_turn == false, the last thing played was an 'O'.
// Hint: If you know the game was not over when an 'X' was played,
// you don't need to look for 'O's, and vice-versa.
