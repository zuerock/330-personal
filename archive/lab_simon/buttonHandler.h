// The only thing this function does is return a boolean flag set by the
// buttonHandler state machine. To wit: Once enabled, the buttonHandler
// state-machine first waits for a touch. Once a touch is detected, the
// buttonHandler state-machine computes the region-number for the touched area.
// Next, the buttonHandler state-machine waits until the player removes their
// finger. At this point, the state-machine should set a bool flag that
// indicates the the player has removed their finger. Once the buttonHandler()
// state-machine is disabled, it should clear this flag.
// All buttonHandler_releasedDetected() does is return the value of this flag.
// As such, the body of this function should only contain a single line of code.
// If this function does more than return a boolean set by the buttonHandler
// state machine, you are going about this incorrectly.
